Now it is super easy to tweak your content Typography in Gutenberg WordPress Editor using the Editor Plus plugin. 😮

You can easily adjust the following font properties visually using the "Typography" panel available for content blocks.

* Font Weight
* Font Style
* Font Size
* Letter Spacing
* Line Height
* Color

And as Editor Plus allows you to tweak these options for Responsive and Hover, this makes it easier for you to adjust your typography for mobile & tablet differently.

## 💎 Add Icons anywhere (RichText) in Gutenberg Editor 💎

Need to insert an icon? EditorPlus brings icons integration that enables you to insert icons anywhere where you can insert text. You can add icons to paragraphs, headlines, buttons, or any other place where you can write text in the editor. Additionally, you can also apply a background color, add a border, and set border-radius to the icons. Currently, we've included Font Awesome and Icon Moon icon libraries, but, we may add more in the future.  

## 🌈 Add Nice SVG Shape Dividers in Gutenberg Editor 🌈

SVG shape dividers or separators add a nice visual effect to your section or content. Now you can easily add and customize it in Gutenberg WordPress Editor. Currently supported on the following blocks:

* Cover Block
* Columns Block & inner Column Block
* Group Block

As it is available for the Group block means you can simply group any block(s) content and add a shape divider to the group.
