⭐️ All these stylings can be adjusted for Responsive (Desktop, Tablet & mobile) and Hover!

## Custom CSS Editor for Power Users

You can write your custom CSS code as well. The custom CSS code box will be available for all Gutenberg core blocks as well as via the plugin admin area for writing global CSS that applies throughout your website (including Gutenberg editor screen).

## 🔥 Add Blocks from Block Library at GutenbergHub 🔥

Need a block? Search from the [Gutenberg Blocks Directory](https://gutenberghub.com/blocks?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=editorplus) at GutenbergHub and copy one to your website using the blocks page from the EditorPlus admin area.

## ✏️ Tweak Content Typography in Gutenberg WordPress

Now it is super easy to tweak your content Typography in Gutenberg WordPress Editor using the Editor Plus plugin. 😮

You can easily adjust the following font properties visually using the "Typography" panel available for content blocks.

* Font Weight
* Font Style
* Font Size
* Letter Spacing
* Line Height
* Color

And as Editor Plus allows you to tweak these options for Responsive and Hover, this makes it easier for you to adjust your typography for mobile & tablet differently.

## 💎 Add Icons anywhere (RichText) in Gutenberg Editor 💎

Need to insert an icon? EditorPlus brings icons integration that enables you to insert icons anywhere where you can insert text. You can add icons to paragraphs, headlines, buttons, or any other place where you can write text in the editor. Additionally, you can also apply a background color, add a border, and set border-radius to the icons. Currently, we've included Font Awesome and Icon Moon icon libraries, but, we may add more in the future.  

## 🌈 Add Nice SVG Shape Dividers in Gutenberg Editor 🌈

SVG shape dividers or separators add a nice visual effect to your section or content. Now you can easily add and customize it in Gutenberg WordPress Editor. Currently supported on the following blocks:

* Cover Block
* Columns Block & inner Column Block
* Group Block

As it is available for the Group block means you can simply group any block(s) content and add a shape divider to the group.

## 🦸‍♂️ Be a Pro - Copy & Paste Block Styles & Responsive Visual Editing 🦸‍♂️

Starting with Editor Plus v1.6.0, now you can copy a block style and paste it to another block with a click quickly. You do not need to re-style the same thing again and again. 

This release also improved responsive editing features by synchronizing the responsive previewer window.

More exciting features and enhancements are planned for the WordPress Gutenberg Editor. Stay tuned for updates. 😇
